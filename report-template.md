## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of this analysis is to create and determine the efficacy of a logistic regression model in predicting both healthy loan and high-risk loan labels.
* The data was based on the loan size, interest rate,	borrower income, debt to income ratio of borrower,	num of accounts, derogatory marks, and total_debt.
* The model was designed to predict the loan status, healthy or high-risk, based on the financial features.
* As part of this analysis, we went through the stages of the Machine learning process. 1. Define the problem - the need to accurately predict whether or not a loan is high-risk.
2. Collect and prepare data - we uploaded the csv file and separated the target and feature points. 3.Choose a model - chose linear regression model 4. Trained the model 5. Evaluated the model using confusion matrix. 6 and 7, tuned and tested the model. 8. Deploy the model.
* Logistic regression model was used in this analysis


## Results


* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Machine Learning Model 1 was a Logistic Regression Model. The classification score for Healthy Loans was perfect Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores. The scores for the machine learning model for high-risk loans was less, with 0.87 precision, 0.95 recall, giving it an F1-score of 0.91. 

## Summary

* The linear regression model performed exceptionally well for healthy loans and while there is some room for improvement in the prediction of high-risk loans, it still performs well based on looking at the 
* The performance of this model is exceptional in predicting healthy loans and performs well for predicting high-risk loans. It is often more important for a financial institution to be able to predict the high-risk loans to better mitigate risk to the institution, but there is also benefit in being able to predict a healthy loan.
